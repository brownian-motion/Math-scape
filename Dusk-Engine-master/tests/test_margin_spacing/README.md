## Margin and Spacing Tests ##

The files found in this folder are margin and spacing tests for Dusk.

In each of these tests, the margin and spacing is adjusted to get the same effect in Tiled. That means that all these should render indentically in Dusk (implying the Dusk margin and spacing equation is working correctly - yay!).

You won't find a Runtest file in this folder.

## Result ##

These tests were last run for version 0.1 of Dusk. Tests worked.
