## Dusk Demos ##

This is a folder of Dusk demos. To run them, first copy the Dusk library into the appropriate folder, then run the `main.lua` as usual.

#### Demo List ####
* Spin: Spin a wheel/ball around a map. Implements simple (ground-only) tile physics using line segment intersection and `enterFrame` loops.
* Bob: A generic maze game. Uses Box2D for physical interaction.
